# Vino Project

{frontmatter.publishDate}

This is your first markdown page. It probably isn't styled much, although
Markdown does support **bold** and _italics._

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

Add a `.mdx` file to your `pages` directory and Astro
will turn it into a page on your site. MDX files make
it easy to mix components from any framework with
your text content.

```swift
struct Person: Identifiable {
    var id = UUID()
    var name: String
    var isContacted = false
}
```

To learn more about adding a layout to your page, read the next section on **Markdown Layouts.**

- update the frontmatter to `draft: false` or
- remove the `draft` property entirely.
